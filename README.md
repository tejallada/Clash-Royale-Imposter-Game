**Clash Royale Imposter Game:**
Made by Tej Allada

Based off the popular "Imposter" game flowing around social media right now this program is designed so that you and your group of friends can pass around the device and have each person get assigned either "Imposter", where they dont have a card, or "Not the Imposter" where they get the same card as everyone else but the imposter. In this popular game you are to go around and say a word associated with your card but disguised enough so the imposter doesn't catch on and also say words similar to those that do know the card. After 2 round where everyone has each said 1 word at each round, the group discusses and votes out the imposter. If the group is correct they win, however if the group does not vote correct the imposter wins.

How to run the program:
1) Enter the number of players (must be greater than 2)
2) Enter each players name
3) Pass the device to the person who is first displayed
4) Once the person has the device they click enter to see their role and the card
5) The person clicks enter again ad passes the device to the person whos name is displayed as "next"
6) Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all the players have seen their roles
7) Put the device to the side, choose a person to start, and have fun!
